HTTP/2 is already running in some servers, but they are not many at this moment.
In fact, if you have seen HTTP/2 in the wild, chances are that it is being served
from some big company.
The reason is not a big mistery: there are still very few HTTP/2 implementations.
And even less deployed sites.
That's why we are trying to create a new one, and why you are seeing this website.
