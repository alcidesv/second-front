[HTTP/2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/2) promises a different kind of Web: 
one which is faster for end-users, 
more efficient for users and servers,
and *potentially* easier for developers. 
This web site is for finding out how this promise evolves.
And to practice what we preach, the pages of this website are served using 
an experimental 
HTTP/2 server.
You can find both the server and the site's contents
at [Github](https://github.com/alcidesv/second-front).
