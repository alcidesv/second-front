HTTP/2 promises a different kind of Web: one which is faster
for users, and *potentially* easier for developers. 
This site is for finding out how this promise becomes a reality.

The pages of this website served using an experimental 
HTTP/2 server, and are generated using [Jekyll](http://http://jekyllrb.com/).
You can find both the server and the site's contents
at [Github](https://github.com/alcidesv/second-front).
